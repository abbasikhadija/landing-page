# Landing Page – Atomic Habits Inspired

This project is a simple, responsive landing page built as a learning exercise in HTML, CSS, and layout fundamentals.  
The concept and content are **inspired by *Atomic Habits* by James Clear**, focusing on the idea that small, consistent improvements lead to meaningful results over time.

---

## 📘 Inspiration

The landing page draws inspiration from the core principles of *Atomic Habits*, particularly:

- Small habits compound into remarkable results
- Systems are more important than goals
- Consistency matters more than intensity
- Environment and design influence behavior

The goal was **not to copy the book**, but to translate its ideas into a clean, visual, and structured web page.

## 🧠 What I Learned & Applied

Through this project, I practiced and applied:

### HTML
- Semantic structure (`header`, sections, content hierarchy)
- Organizing content into logical, reusable blocks
- Accessibility basics (alt text, readable structure)

### CSS
- Flexbox for layout and alignment
- Spacing and visual hierarchy
- Reusable styles for buttons and sections
- Styling call-to-action components
- Managing global vs section-specific styles

### Design & Thinking
- Turning abstract ideas into UI content
- Creating a clear visual flow (hero → information → quote → CTA)
- Applying minimal, intentional design inspired by habit-building philosophy
